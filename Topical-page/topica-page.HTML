    <H2> Module 1, task 3 - political consequences of internet</H2>
    
    <p class="Fiksebilde">
    
        <img id="bilde1" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/05/31/10/55/man-791049_960_720.jpg" alt="A man reading some info on his touchscreen with a cup of tea on right side"> The <strong>internet is one of many infrastructures people use daily</strong>, and with the <strong>ground-breaking
    innovation, also came consequences</strong>. To highlight a positive political effect, the <strong>internet is a
    common platform available to everyone </strong> and the <strong>availability allows more people to reach out
    to the society and to be heard</strong>. However, <strong>due to algorithms</strong>, a consequence of the internet
    can be that <strong>a user is often exposed to content aligned with the users’ own opinions</strong>. As
    Garimella et al. (2018) discuss, there is evidence supporting a so-called echo-chamber for
    contentious topics, which arguably politics can be. <strong>The echo-chamber can be defined as
    limiting the exposure to diverse perspectives and favor the formation of groups of
    like-minded users framing and reinforcing a shared narrative (Cinelli et al., 2021)</strong>. The
    echo-chamber raises an ethical question whether the internet can influence political choices
    and or behavior. <strong>If the left-wing only view left-wing videos, articles, comments, and news,
    among more, and the right-wing vice versa, the internet can contribute to political views and
    opinions on a subject </strong>. An example could be the comment section of an article. A user might
    be skeptical about his or her stance on a political subject but could get the impression that
    everyone agrees in the comments. This might incline the user to believe that more people
    agree than reality reflects.

    <H2> Module 1, task 4 - social responsibility of innovators</H2>
    
    <p class="Fiksebilde">
    
        <img id="bilde2" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/10/10/05/04/train-60539_960_720.jpg" alt="A green train in action during a snowy winterday"> <strong>Inventing new technology will most of the time be beneficial, but it can also be dangerous as
    it can come with consequences</strong>. The statement is a good example of how something so
    smart and useful for us, could also kill a lot of people. <strong>The person who invented the train did
    also invent consequences </strong>, but as of this case he did the world a big favor. He <strong>invented
    something that can be dangerous, but as they try to minimize the risk of it being dangerous</strong>,
    we need to acknowledge how good the trains function as of today. The social responsibility
    of innovators is important. We need to acknowledge what the inventions can do to society. It
    is also important to say how we want to firm the world, as discussed <q>Responsible innovation
    urges us to reflect on what kind of world we want to live in and who should be involved in
    designing it.</q> (Ucl. 2022). This statement is important as it needs to be reflected that
    inventing new things can go wrong; we need to think about how we want the world to be. A
    good example is <strong>the inventing of the nuclear bombs, how this inventing can kill the whole
    world fallen into the wrong hands. Social responsibility should be one of the main topics
    when inventing something new.</strong>
